// Matt: also to work around various net client problems caused by replication timing issues, including common problems when deploying into a spawn vehicle:
/** SPAWN VEHICLE PROBLEMS:
    The process of deploying into a spawn vehicle involves spawning a player pawn, possessing it, then entering the vehicle
    Entering results in unpossessing the player pawn, possessing vehicle, moving (effectively teleporting) player pawn to vehicle's location & attaching it as the 'Driver' pawn
    Because vehicle can be on other side of the map & not currently net relevant to the client, the vehicle actors may not exist on the client & have to be spawned locally
    There are a complex series of interactions, which don't always happen in the same order, because actors are not always replicated in the same order

 1. First problem is that the PlayerController is often in state 'Spectating' when the critical PC.ClientRestart() function gets called at the end of vehicle possession
    State 'Spectating' ignores PC.ClientRestart(), most critically resulting in the PC's ViewTarget not being set to the vehicle & POVChanged() not being called on the vehicle
    This gives a completely screwed up camera view, until the player switches to another vehicle position or exits
    After experimenting with various workarounds, I believe the fix below is probably the simplest & cleanest, & it appears to work reliably
    We send the client's PlayerController to state 'PlayerWalking' because that's the normal state a player would be in when entering a vehicle (so it's effectively neutral)
    It is essentially a hack, but it seems to be an effective, safe & minimal hack to achieve a specific & vital purpose (so it's a 'good hack'!)

 2. Second problem affects VehicleWeaponPawns with a VehicleWeapon, i.e. MGs & cannons, where client may not yet have received the VehicleWeapon actor through replication
    Without VW actor, state 'EnteringVehicle' will fail to switch to an interior mesh or play BeginningIdleAnim, which can really screw things up, until player transitions or exits
    Fix is if we don't yet have VW actor, we avoid going into state 'EnteringVehicle' now & instead flag that we need to as soon as PostNetReceive() detects we receive VW actor

 3. Third, lesser problem is that client may not yet have received the VehicleBase actor through replication, in which case we can't set StoredVehicleRotation
    Without StoredVehicleRotation, the player gets an unwanted camera swivelling effect on entering the vehicle
    Fix is if we don't yet have VehicleBase actor, we flag that we need to set StoredVehicleRotatio as soon as PostNetReceive() detects we receive VehicleBase actor */
