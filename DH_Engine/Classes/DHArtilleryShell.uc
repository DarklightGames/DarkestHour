// New function to set InstigatorController as the arty officer who called the strike, passed to us by our artillery spawner actor
// Need to set this as don't natively get an Instigator pawn reference as other projectiles do, so PostBeginPlay() fails to get an InstigatorController
// Note we could get Instigator natively by setting the arty spawner's Instigator, which would automatically set Instigator for every shell it spawned
// But Instigator reference would be unreliable due to delay between calling arty & shells being spawned, as player may have died or moved into a vehicle pawn
// Also, this method differs from deprecated ROArtilleryShell, which made the InstigatorController the owner of each shell & used that to get the reference
// Old method meant shell was always net relevant to player who called arty as he was its owner & its Instigator (either makes shell always relevant)
// New method avoids that, so if player re-spawns or otherwise moves well away from arty strike, server can decide whether shells are relevant & should be replicated
// Although we have to avoid setting Instigator here, it does get set in the only place it's needed, which is HurtRadius(), that calls UpdateInstigator()
