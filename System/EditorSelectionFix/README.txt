At long last, the editor selection click-delay that plagued the game since the advent of Windows 8 has been fixed by his holiness, Metallicafan212 of the OldUnreal community.

It is fixed by replacing the D3DDrv.dll in this directory with the one that comes packaged with Red Orchestra: Ostfront.

The editor .bat files will automatically overwrite the DLL before launching the editor.

Known issues with the current fix:

* Anything in the sky zone will take selection precedence. Just turn off the sky zone to get around this.
* You cannot right-click in empty space to get the context menu up. Most functionality is still available in the top window menus.
