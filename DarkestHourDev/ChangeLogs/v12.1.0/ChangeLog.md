# Counter-Battery!
In this update, we are adding an new (somewhat experimental) mechanic that we think will add some depth and complexity to the current artillery gameplay. We call this system "counter-battery".

## How it Works
When you fire an artillery piece, enemy players will be able to see a short temporary marker approximating the location of your gun. The accuracy of this mark is dependent on the size of the gun, where larger guns (e.g., 10.5cm howitzers) have more accurate marks than smaller ones (e.g., 8cm mortars).

As the gun is continually fired, keen-eyed observers can estimate a position of the enemy gun and mark it for counter-battery fire. To aid in this, there is a new "Enemy Artillery" spotting type that can be marked on the map.

## Motivation
In the current meta, long-range artillery pieces are virtually immune from attack unless the enemy can get a direct sight on them. This is at odds with the battlefield reality of the time, where sophisticated artillery ranging equipment was deployed to locate enemy guns with acoustic listening posts, a technology birthed out of necessity in the Great War, and significantly improved during World War 2.

We hope that this change will have the following effects:

* Create a meaningful advantage to wise placement of artillery pieces (i.e., dissuading players from creating tightly packed batteries that are easy to locate and destroy)
* Create a major advantage to mobile artillery (e.g., Wespe, Priest) by allowing them to evade incoming counter-battery fire.
* Create another objective for artillery operators other than responding to fire request markers.

# Future Plans
The current downsides for this are that the 8cm mortars and pack howitzers are now uniquely vulnerable to enemy fire since they are unable to be moved. We plan on adding the ability to pick these up and move them in the future (this system is already implemented for the mounted MG system which is currently in development).

# Trivia
* This system was inspired by the Blitzkrieg series of games by Nival Interactive.
* We toyed with the idea of adding physical constructions for the listening posts that would be more accurate depending on different triangulation characteristics, but we did not want to further burden logistics players.

## Things to address before release:

* Add a Mortar Pit construction! This can be used to protect the stationary mortar.
* Mention new "socket" system for constructions; this is unique to this update and will be expanded when we add mounted MGs.
