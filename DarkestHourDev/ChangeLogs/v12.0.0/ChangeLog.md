# v12.0.0 - Darkest Hour: Europe '44-'45 - Italy Expansion Change Log

At *long last* and after much anticipation, we are proud to announce the release of the Italy Expansion for Darkest Hour: Europe '44-'45!

As the name implies, this expansion adds the Italian faction to the game, as well as a bevy of new vehicles, weapons, and maps.

This has been a huge undertaking for our team, and speaking as the team lead, I'm very proud of everything that we've accomplished. We know that all the content we've created for this update is by far the best we've ever made, and think you'll agree.

## The Italian Army

![Italian Soldiers](./Media/Meet%20the%20Italians.png)

Coming out of the crucible of World War I, Italian did not fare very well. Although it had ostensibly been victorious, its ambitions of vast territorial expansion had been thwarted by post-war treaties, leaving the political landscape of Italy in turmoil.

The rise of Benito Mussolini and the fascist party in the 1920s saw a renewed interest in military expansionism, culminating in the successful Italian invasions of Ethiopia and Albania in the 1930s in an attempt to restore the lost glory of the Roman Empire around the Mediterranean Sea (the "Mare Nostrum", lit. "Our Sea").

Italy declared war on the Allies in 1940 during the invasion of France, launching a very unsuccessful attack through the Alps. Soon after, it launched a disastrous invasion of Greece in 1940. What was expected to be a quick victory against a relatively weak opponent turned into a prolonged and costly campaign, requiring German assistance to stabilize the front.

The war dragged on, and following the Axis' stunning defeat at Stalingrad in February of 1943, Axis territorial gains in the east were being erased with increasing speed. The Axis forces had been pushed out of North Africa in May of 1943, undoing virtually all of the Italian conquests of the previous decade.

It is amidst this backdrop that Operation Husky, the Allied invasion of Sicily, began in July 1943.

## Interface

## Localization

The game has now been fully localized to **Russian** and **Ukrainian**. As a result, players are now able to type in Cyrillic characters in the game's chat.

![title info](./Media/Localization%20Ukrainian.png)

Historically, the game only had partial localization support for German. However, the localizations had never been updated after its initial release well over a decade ago.

We have developed a system that will allow us to add localization for more languages in the future as well as keep the existing ones up to date as the game continues to evolve. We hope that this will make the game more accessible to players from all over the world.

If you'd like to help us localize the game into your native language, please visit our [localization portal](https://weblate.darklightgames.com)!

## Map Icon Overhaul

The map icons for vehicles and stationary weapons have been completely overhauled to be more accurate to the equipment that they represent.

To help with battlefield awareness, friendly guns & vehicle icons are now color-coded to indicate their status. For example, unoccupied anti-tank guns will now be colored grey, while occupied ones will be blue, or green if the occupant is a squadmate.

Finally, all friendly vehicles will now be visible on the map at all times. We will monitor if this has a negative impact on the usability of the map, and will adjust as necessary.

The icon used for vehicle spawn points has been modified so as not to obscure the icon for the vehicle itself, so you should have a better idea of what kind of vehicle you're spawning into.

## Font Overhaul

To accommodate the localization efforts, all the game's fonts have been completely overhauled!

We have tried to keep the original aesthetic of the fonts while making them more readable and consistent. For example, drop-shadowing is now applied more consistently across the UI, making the text easier to read.

In addition, text will scale more consistently based on the resolution. As a result, players using higher resolutions (e.g. 2K) will be pleased to find that the game's fonts are no longer unreadably small.

## Vehicles
This update sees the addition of 9 brand new vehicles to the game; 8 of which are unique to the Italian faction.

### Autoblinda 41
This Autoblinda 41 armored car is a fast and extremely maneuverable vehicle excellent for scouting and anti-infantry. Its 20mm cannon is capable of destroying light vehicles with ease, but will be dramatically less effective attempting to engage even lightly armored tanks head-on.

It is also unique in that it is the only vehicle in the game with a rear-facing machine-gun, allowing it to defend itself from enemy infantry tempting to flank it.

![Autoblinda 41](./Media/Autoblinda%2041%20Front.png)

### Autocarretta OM 32, 36P

The Autocaretta OM 32 and 36P are light trucks used for both transporting troops and supplies. Despite its small size and underpowered engine, the OM 36P can transport 10 men, and the OM 32 can carry a half load of supplies (1000 supplies instead of the normal 2000).

![OM 36P](./Media/OM%2036P.png)
![OM 32](./Media/OM%2032.png)

### Carro Velocce 33 (CV-33, L3/33)
One of the smallest armored vehicles fielded by any nation during the war, this tankette is nimble and lightly armored. It is armed with two 6.5mm machine-guns. Despite it's diminutive stature, it excels at scouting and harassing enemy infantry and light vehicles while keeping a very low profile.

![Carro Velocce 33](./Media/CV33%20Front.png)

### Fiat 508CM
The Fiat 508CM is a light utility vehicle used mainly as a scouting and staff car. One unique feature of the Fiat 508CM is that it has a working radio in the back seat, allowing squad leaders to call in artillery strikes from the front lines.

![Fiat 508CM](./Media/Fiat%20508%20CM%20Front.png)

### Fiat 626
The workhorse hauler of the Italian army, the Fiat 626 is capable of carrying a large number of troops and supplies. It has no armaments, so like any light vehicle, it is vulnerable to all manner of enemy fire.

![Fiat 626](./Media/Fiat%20626%20Front.png)

### Fiat L6/40
A light tank armed with a 20mm cannon and a 8mm machine-gun; the majority of these were destroyed or captured by the Allies during the North African campaign. It can excel at engaging lightly armored vehicles and unsupported infantry, but will struggle against anything with more than a few millimeters of armor.

![Fiat L6/40](./Media/Fiat%20L640%20Front.png)

### Semovente 47/32
Ther most produced Italian self-propelled gun of the war, the Semovente 47/32 is armed with a 47mm cannon capable of penetrating most enemy tanks from the side and rear. It's low profile and good maneuverability make it an excellent ambush vehicle, but it's thin armor and an open-topped turret make it extremely vulnerable to enemy fire.

![Semovente 47/32](./Media/Semovente%2047%20Front.png)

### Semovente 90/53
A self-propelled gun sporting a devastating 90mm cannon, the Semovente 90/53 is capable of easily destroying any enemy vehicle it encounters. This power comes with a pretty dramatic drawback, though, since the small chassis can can only carry 8 extra rounds. The gun crew is also exposed to enemy fire from its rear. However, with good positioning, accurate gunnery, and logistical support, it has the potential to be the deciding factor in any battle.

![Semovente 90/53](./Media/Semovente%2090%20Front.png)

### DUKW
The DUKW is a versatile amphibious vehicle used by the United States landing forces in Sicily to transports troops and supplies to the landing beaches and beyond. It's enormous size and poor maneuverability makes it difficult to use inland, so it's better suited for the open sea.

![DUKW](./Media/DUKW.png)

## Guns

### Cannone da 47/32
The Cannone da 47/32 is a light 47mm anti-tank gun capable of decent penetration, though it will struggle against heavier tanks like the M4 Sherman, especially from the front. Despite this, it's very low profile makes it difficult to spot, especially when the wheels are removed.

![Cannone da 47/32](./Media/Cannone%2047%20Back%20Right.png)

### Mortaio da 81/14 mod. 35
Based on the French Brandt mortar, this was the most successful mortar of the Italian armed forces during the war. It can fire high-explosive shells, smoke shells and an extra large high-explosive shell with additional 
The most successful mortar of the Italian armed forces during the war. Based on the French Brandt Mle 27/31, the Mortaio da 81/14 mod. 35 is a medium 81mm mortar capable of firing a variety of rounds, as well as an ultra-heavy high-explosive round, as pictured below.

![Mortaio da 81/14 mod. 35](./Media/8cm%20Mortar.png)

### Weapons

### Beretta mod. 34
This compact semi-automatic pistol was the standard sidearm of the Italian army. Despite it's relatively underpowered .380 ACP cartridge, it's small size and light weight made it a popular choice for officers and other personnel who needed a sidearm that was easy to carry.

### Breda mod. 30
There are many things that have been said about the Breda modello 30; most of them not very flattering. Intended as a squad light machine-gun, it's heavy weight, low effective rate of fire, and bizarre loading mechanism made it extremely ineffective in it's assigned role. We've taken great pains to make sure that the Breda modello 30 is as historically accurate as possible (including animating ammo being spilled out on reloads), so players will be able to experience the same boiling frustration that the Italian soldiers did.

### Carcano M91/38
The Carcano M91/38 is a bolt-action rifle that was the standard issue rifle of the Italian army. It's 6.5mm cartridge is comparatively underpowered compared to the standard issue rifles of other nations, but it's light weight and good handling characteristics made it a popular choice for the Italian infantry.

> Developer Highlight: When chambering the final round, you can hear the distinctive "ping" of the en-bloc clip being ejected from the bottom of the rifle.

> Developer Highlight: The magazine has an open window and ammo counter on the box magazine, so you can see the spring decompress and well as how many rounds are left in the magazine as it's emptied. To our knowledge, this is the first time this has been accurately modeled in a video game.

### Fucile Controcarro 35(P)
Originally of Polish origin as the Wz. 35, the Fucile Controcarro 35(P) is a bolt-action, magazine-fed anti-tank rifle with an impressive high-velocity cartridge capable of penetrating most light tanks from the side and rear.

### MAB mod. 38-A
The Italian sub-machine gun was a very effective weapon owing to it's great handling and high rate of fire. Unfortunately, it was issued almost exclusively to Blackshirt divisions that were attached to larger army groups. As a result, it was rarely seen in the hands of regular infantry units.

This weapon can be found exclusively in the hands of the Italian "Camicie Nere" (Blackshirts).

### OTO Tipo L (Anti-Tank Grenade)
Continuing the theme of extremely dangerous impact fuzed grenades, the OTO Tipo L is a large anti-tank grenade with a powerful 1.5kg explosive charge useful for destroying or immobilizing vehicles. Since it's heavy and can't be thrown far, make sure to throw this from cover!

### SRCM mod. 35
Dubbed the "red devil" by the Allies, the SRCM Mod. 35 was one of the standard hand grenades used by the Italian army. Unlike the standard grenades used by other nations, it uses an impact fuse, making it extremely dangerous to use in close quarters. The impact fuzes had a habit of failing to detonate when landing on soft ground, leaving a live grenade on the ground that could blow up if disturbed.

### SRCM mod. 35 (Incendiary Smoke)
The SRCM Mod. 35 (Incendiary Smoke) is a variant of the standard hand grenade that produces a thick cloud of white phosphorus smoke when detonated. In addition to it's typical use as a smoke screen, the white phosphorus can cause severe burns to anyone unfortunate enough to be near the detonation, as well as being a potentially lethal choking hazard.

## Maps

The Italy expansion sees the addition of 5 brand new maps.

The new maps in this first Italian expansion are focused on Operation Husky, the invasion of Sicily in 1943. They follow the historical progression of the Battle of Gela, where US 1st and 2nd Infantry Divisions landed against the Italian 4th Infantry "Livorno" Division and the German 1st Fallschirm-Panzer Division Hermann Göring. Their goal was to secure the town of Gela, then push inland to capture the critical airfield at Ponte Olivo.

### Gela (32+ players)

The town of Gela was one of the main landing points for the invasion of Sicily due to its proximity to the Ponte Olivo airfield.

The invaders will have to fight their way off the beaches, ascend through a dense urban area, then push outwards into the sprawling Sicilan countryside.

![Gela](./Media/Gela%2002.png)|!![Gela](./Media/Gela%2003.png)|

### Niscemi Outkirts (24-64 players)


### Ponte Olivo Airfield (32-64 players)
Capturing the airfield at Ponte Olivo was critical to the success of the invasion of Sicily, both to deny the German and Italian forces the ability to use it, and to grant the Allies a staging ground for their own air operations further inland.

### San Valentino (24-64 players)
This popular map has been completely re-imagined for the Italy expansion. The original map allegedly took place in the Italian countryside, though it certainly didn't look the part!

This is a fictional scenario set during the full-scale retreat of the Italian Livorno Division back to more defensible positions once the Allies had established unassailable beachheads.

### Villa Cecila (8-32 players)
This map is a fictional representation of a palatial estate in the Sicilian countryside. It is a small, infantry-only map with a focus on close-quarters combat in and around the villa.

# Mortar Overhaul
Mortars have been a part of Darkest Hour since they were introduced back in 2010 with the 5.0 update. While they were a great addition to the game, they have had a number of issues that only got more pronounced as the game continued to evolve. Our goals in this overhaul was to:

* Improve the controls to be smooth and more intuitive.
* Upgrade the visuals to a modern standard (model, animations etc.)
* Fill the capability gap across factions and eliminate historical inconsistencies (e.g., British and Soviets previously had no native mortars)

This update aims to address all the points above, as well as laying the technical groundwork for additional stationary weapons in the future (e.g., tripod mounted machine-guns).

## New Mortars

### 82-BM-36 Mortar (Soviet Union, Poland)
### Granatwerfer 34 (Germany)
### M1 Mortar (United States of America)
### M2 Mortar (United States of America)
### Ordnance ML 3-inch Mortar (Britain, Canada)
Technically not a new addition, but a rework of the M2 Mortar. This is now the only mortar that can be picked up and transported by infantry.

### Gameplay Changes
* Mortar Operator roles have been removed.
* All players are now able to use mortars like other stationary weapons.
* All mortars are either pre-placed or can be built as a constructions.
* Players can now sprint, prone, jump and mantle while transporting light mortars.
* The Kurz Granatwerfer 34 has been removed. This was in reality a weapon used almost exclusively by the Fallschrimjäger, so its inclusion on every map was ahistoric. It has been replaced by the larger Granatwerfer 34. We have decided to remove this rather than leave it in as the last vestige of a deprecated system.

> In future, we want to introduce additional small mortars to the game that can be transported by infantry such as the British 2 inch and Brixia Model 35.

# Gameplay Changes
* Players can now capture and use enemy stationary weapons. However, these weapons cannot be resupplied by the capturing team.
* Vehicle passengers may no longer use vehicle voice commands intended for crew members only.
* Squad leaders and assistant squad leaders are now given wire cutters by default.

# Logistics Changes

## New Variant & Skin System
Players can now select different variants and skins for guns placed in the world. 

For example, the Cannone 47/32 has two variants, one with wheels and one without, this selection affects how high the gun sits.

[[ INSERT GIF OF CHANGING GUN VARIANTS ]]

Skins are also selectable, although winter skins will only be available on winter maps.

## Category & Limits Overhaul

The construction loadouts system has been overhauled to allow for easier and more fine-grained control over what each team can build on a map.

In the past, constructions could only be limited by "category" (e.g., light anti-tank guns, heavy anti-tank guns, etc.), and had to be defined per-level, which was a manual and time intensive ordeal that was prone to human error and oversight.

Now, we have per-nation default construction loadout limits, as well as retaining the ability to further restrict individual constructions on a per-level basis. This should dramatically reduce the amount of over-the-top "gun spam" that can occur.

In addition, there are now hard limits on the amount of total constructions that can be built, whereas before there was only a soft limit that could be fairly easily bypassed. This new behavior mirrors the total & active limitations in the vehicle spawning system.

[[ INSERT GIF OF NEW GUN CONSTRUCTION MENU SHOWING LIMITS ]]

# Vehicles
* Vehicle cannons can now be fired while the commander is looking through the periscope.

> This is implemented on new vehicles only. This functionality will be added to pre-existing vehicles in a future update.

# Miscellaneous
* Grenades that have a "spoon" will now have the spoon fly off when the grenade is thrown (e.g., Mk. II grenade, F1 grenade etc.)
* The artillery response delay has been standardized to 15 seconds for all teams instead of relying on the length of the request sound effect.

# Bug Fixes
* Voice commands audio sources will now be properly attached to the player pawn instead of the the location of the player when they issued the command.
* Voice commands will no longer continue to play after the player has died.
* Patron spotting signals will now be properly displayed in-world and send a voice command.
* Fixed a bug where it was possible for boat vehicles to become immobile if the driver ever left the driver's seat.
* Tracer rounds for some weapons (Bren, ZB30 etc.) will no longer be misaligned with the barrel from the perspective of the gunner.
* Fixed a bug where the pre-launch-trace would suppress tracer rounds from being spawned when firing at nearby targets. 

# SDK
* A team-specific delay to spawning during the setup phase can be added using the neww `TeamAddSpawningEnabledTime` property in the `DHSetupPhaseManager`.
* Roles can now be locked and unlocked by firing events to the new `DH_ModifyRole` actor.
* Spawn points can now be set to only allow vehicles to spawn using the new `ESPT_VehicleOnly` spawn point type (previously, `ESPT_Vehicle` spawn points would allow tank crewmen to spawn on foot).
* Spawn points can now be set to only spawn boat vehicles using the new `bBoatSpawn` spawn point property.
