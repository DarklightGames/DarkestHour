# v12.0.0 - Darkest Hour: Europe '44-'45 - Italy Expansion Change Log

At long last and after much anticipation, we are proud to announce the release of the Italy Expansion for Darkest Hour: Europe '44-'45!

As the name implies, this expansion adds the Italian faction to the game, as well as a bevy of new vehicles, weapons, and maps.

This has been a huge undertaking for our team, and speaking as the team lead, I'm very proud of everything that we've accomplished. We know that all the content we've created for this update are by far the best we've ever made, and think you'll agree.

## Meet the Italians

## Interface

## Localization

The game has now been fully localized to Russian and Ukrainian. As a result, players are now able to type in Cyrillic characters in the game's chat.

Historically, the game only had partial localization support for German. However, the localizations had never been updated after it's initial release well over a decade ago.

We have developed a system for localization that will allow us to easily add more languages in the future as well as keep the existing ones up to date as the game continues to evolve. We hope that this will make the game more accessible to players from all over the world.

If you'd like to help us localize the game into your native language, please visit our [localization portal](https://weblate.darklightgames.com)!

## Font Overhaul

To accomodate the localization efforts, all of the game's fonts have been completely overhauled!

We have tried to keep the original aesthetic of the fonts while making them more readable and consistent. For example, drop-shadowing is now applied more consistently across the UI, making the text easier to read.

In addition, players who play at higher resolutions (e.g. 4K) will be pleased to find that the game's fonts are no longer unreadably small.

## Vehicles

### DUKW
The DUKW is a versatile amphibious vehicle used by the United States landing forces in the Sicily to transports troops and supplies to the landing beaches and beyond. It's enormous size and poor maneuverability makes it difficult to use inland, so it's better suited for the open sea.

### Carro Velocce 33 (CV-33, L3/33)
One of the smallest armored vehicles fielded by any nation during the war, this tankette is nimble and lightly armored. It is armed with two 6.5mm machine-guns. Despite it's diminutive stature, it excels at scouting and harassing enemy infantry and light vehicles while keeping a very low profile.

### Semovente 90/53
A self-propelled gun sporting a devastating 90mm cannon, the Semovente 90/53 is capable of easily destroying any enemy vehicle it encounters. This power comes with a pretty dramatic drawback, though, as the chassis can can only carry a contingent of 8 extra rounds. In addition, the gun crew is exposed to enemy fire from its rear. However, with good positioning and logistical support, it has the potential to be the deciding factor in any battle.

### Autoblinda 41
This Autoblinda 41 armored car is a fast and extremely maneuverable vehicle excellent for scouting and anti-infantry. It's 20mm cannon is capable of destroying light vehicles with ease, but will be dramatically less effective attempting to engage even lightly armored tanks head-on.

It is also unique in that it is the only vehicle in the game with a rear-facing machine-gun, allowing it to defend itself from enemy infantry tempting to flank it.

### Fiat L6/40


### Fiat 626
The workhorse truck of the Italian army, the Fiat 626 is capable of carrying a large number of troops and supplies. It has no armaments, so like any light vehicle, it is vulnerable to all manner of enemy fire.

## Guns

## Cannone da 47/32
The Cannone da 47/32 is a light 47mm anti-tank gun capable of decent penetration, though it will struggle against heavier tanks like the M4 Sherman, especially from the front. Despite this, it's very low profile makes it difficult to spot.

## Fiat-Rivelli 14/35
The Fiat-Rivelli 14/35 is a stationary tripod-mounted machine-gun. It can be deployed as a construction, and like mortars, can be disassembled and moved to a new location if necessary.

This is the first stationary machine-gun to be added to the game, so it will be interesting to see how these will shape the battlefield.

## Weapons

### Carcano M91/38
The Carcano M91/38 is a bolt-action rifle that was the standard issue rifle of the Italian army. It's 6.5mm cartridge is comparatively underpowered compared to the standard issue rifles of other nations, but it's light weight and good handling characteristics made it a popular choice for the Italian infantry.

> Developer Highlight: When chambering the final round, you can hear the distinctive "ping" of the en-bloc clip being ejected from the bottom of the rifle.

### Breda modello 30
There are many things that have been said about the Breda modello 30; most of them not very flattering. Intended as a squad light machine-gun, it's heavy weight, low effective rate of fire, and bizarre loading mechanism made it extremely ineffective in it's assigned role. We've taken great pains to make sure that the Breda modello 30 is as historically accurate as possible (including animating ammo being spilled out on reloads), so players will be able to experience the same boiling frustration that the Italian soldiers did.

> Developer Highlight: The magazine has an open window and ammo counter on the box magazine, so you can see how many rounds are left in the magazine as it's empited. To our knowledge, this is the first time this has been accurately modeled in a video game.

### Moschetto Automatico Beretta 38
The Italian sub-machine gun was a very effective weapon owing to it's great handling and high rate of fire. Unfortunately, it was issued almost exclusively to Blackshirt divisions that were attached to larger army groups. As a result, it was rarely seen in the hands of regular infantry units.

### SRCM Mod. 35
Dubbed the "red devil" by the Allies, the SRCM Mod. 35 was one of the standard hand grenades used by the Italian army. Unlike the grenades used by other nations, it uses an impact fuse, making it extremely dangerous to use in close quarters. The impact fuzes had a habit of not detonating when landing on soft ground, leaving a live grenade on the ground that could blow up if disturbed.

### SRCM Mod. 35 (Incendiary Smoke)
The SRCM Mod. 35 (Incendiary Smoke) is a variant of the standard hand grenade that produces a thick cloud of white phosphorus smoke when detonated. In addition to it's typical use as a smoke screen, the white phosphorus can cause severe burns to anyone unfortunate enough to be near the detonation, as well as being a potentially lethal choking hazard.

### Fucile Controcarro 35(P)
Originally of Polish origin as the Wz. 35, the Fucile Controcarro 35(P) is a bolt-action, magazine-fed anti-tank rifle with an impressive high-velocity cartridge capable of penetrating most light tanks from the side and rear.

### Beretta M1934
This compact semi-automatic pistol was the standard sidearm of the Italian army. Despite it's relatively underpowered .380 ACP cartridge, it's small size and light weight made it a popular choice for officers and other personnel who needed a sidearm that was easy to carry.

### L-Type Hand Grenade (`put the real name in here`)


## Maps

The maps in this first Italian expansion are focused on Operation Husky, the invasion of Sicily in 1943.

The maps follow the historical progression of the Battle of Gela, where US 1st and 2nd Infantry Divisions landed against the Italian 4th Infantry "Livorno" Division and the German 1st Fallschirm-Panzer Division Hermann GÃ¶ring. Their goal was to secure the town of Gela, then push inland to capture the critical airfield at Ponte Olivo.
